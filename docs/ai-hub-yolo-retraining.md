# Retrain YOLO on AI-Hub

## Overview

Qualcomm AI Hub provides a powerful and streamlined way to quantize YOLO models that have been retrained for specific use cases. This guide will walk you through the process of using AI Hub to optimize your custom-trained YOLO models for deployment on Qualcomm devices.

## Why Use AI Hub for YOLO Quantization?

- **Easy Integration**: Simple Python-based workflow for model quantization
- **Optimized Performance**: EASY Automatic optimization for Qualcomm hardware
- **Flexible Training**: Train your YOLO model using any method you prefer
- **Hardware-Specific Optimization**: Get the best weights for your target device

## Prerequisites

1. Set up Qualcomm AI Hub on your development machine
2. Have a trained YOLO model (weights file)

## Basic Quantization Process

The quantization process is remarkably simple. After setting up AI Hub on your device, you can quantize your model with a single command:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.yolov8_det_quantized.export \
    --device="RB3 Gen 2 (Proxy)" \
    --ckpt-name /content/yolo-rb3gen2-trainer/runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt
```

## End-to-End Example Using Ultralytics

Let's walk through a complete example using the [yolo-rb3gen2-trainer](https://github.com/ramalamadingdong/yolo-rb3gen2-trainer) repository:

1. **Open The Google Collab link in the repository**

2. **Change the background and target pictures**

3. **Run the Collab**

4. **Follow steps above to create the quantized model**

## Understanding the Output

After quantization, AI Hub will provide:
- Optimized model weights
- Performance metrics
- Memory usage statistics
- Inference speed measurements

## Best Practices

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Use representative validation data for quantization
   - Ensure your training data matches your deployment scenario

2. **Model Selection**
   - Start with a smaller model (YOLOv8n) for faster iteration
   - Scale up based on performance requirements

3. **Quantization Settings**
   - Use the default settings for initial testing
   - Fine-tune quantization parameters based on accuracy requirements

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **Device Connection**: Ensure your device is properly connected and recognized by AI Hub
- **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size or model size if encountering memory constraints
- **Accuracy Drop**: Try different quantization schemes or fine-tune the model further

## Next Steps

After quantization, you can:
1. Deploy the optimized model to the RUBIKs Pi
2. Benchmark performance
3. Fine-tune based on real-world results
